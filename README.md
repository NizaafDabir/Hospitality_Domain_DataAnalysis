## Data Transformation
Abhishek Anand is a Revenue Manager of the Hotel who is our stackholder has provided us the Data. We have firstly loaded this Data in Power BI.

## Data Analysis Expression (DAX)
Created Measures using Data Analysis Expression (DAX) in Power BI. Measures and calculated coloumns created are as follows :

- Revenue: `SUM(fact_bookings[revenue_realized])`
- Total Bookings: `COUNT(fact_bookings[booking_id])`
- Total Capacity: `SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[capacity])`
- Total Successful Bookings: `SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[successful_bookings])`
- Occupancy %: `DIVIDE([Total Successful Bookings], [Total Capacity], 0)`
- Average Rating: `AVERAGE(fact_bookings[ratings_given])`
- No of days: `DATEDIFF(MIN(dim_date[date]), MAX(dim_date[date]), DAY) + 1`
- Total Cancelled Bookings: `CALCULATE([Total Bookings], fact_bookings[booking_status]="Cancelled")`
- Cancellation %: `DIVIDE([Total Cancelled Bookings], [Total Bookings])`
- Total Checked Out: `CALCULATE([Total Bookings], fact_bookings[booking_status]="Checked Out")`
- Total No Show Bookings: `CALCULATE([Total Bookings], fact_bookings[booking_status]="No Show")`
- No Show Rate %: `DIVIDE([Total No Show Bookings], [Total Bookings])`
- Booking % by Platform: `DIVIDE([Total Bookings], CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(fact_bookings[booking_platform]))) * 100`
- Booking % by Room Class: `DIVIDE([Total Bookings], CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(dim_rooms[room_class]))) * 100`
- ADR (Average Daily Rate): `DIVIDE([Revenue], [Total Bookings], 0)`
- Realisation %: `1 - ([Cancellation %] + [No Show Rate %])`
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): `DIVIDE([Revenue], [Total Capacity])`
- DBRN (Daily Bookings Rate per No of Days): `DIVIDE([Total Bookings], [No of days])`
- DSRN (Daily Stay Rate per No of Days): `DIVIDE([Total Capacity], [No of days])`
- DURN (Daily Checked Out Rate per No of Days): `DIVIDE([Total Checked Out], [No of days])`
- Revenue WoW Change %: `A week-over-week change for Revenue`
- Occupancy WoW Change %: `A week-over-week change for Occupancy`
- ADR WoW Change %: `A week-over-week change for ADR`
- RevPAR WoW Change %: `A week-over-week change for RevPAR`
- Realisation WoW Change %: `A week-over-week change for Realisation`
- DSRN WoW Change %: `A week-over-week change for DSRN`
